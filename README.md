# Intelligible98.github.io
For CTI-110

My GitHub account username is Intelligible98, my student email is cwfortner@my.waketech.edu. 

I created the account using a personal email address as I expect to be using GitHub in the future.

The repository I created is titled Intelligible98.github.io per assignment instructions.

After I installed the GitHub desktop app, I selected File in the top left corner and chose Clone Repository. I then selected my repository and Cloned/downloaded it to my system.
