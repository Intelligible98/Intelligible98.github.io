My GitHub account username is Intelligible98, my student email is cwfortner@my.waketech.edu. 

I created the account using a personal email address as I expect to be using GitHub in the future.

The repository I created is titled Intelligible98.github.io per assignment instructions.

After I installed the GitHub desktop app, I selected File in the top left corner and chose Clone Repository. I then selected my repository and Cloned/downloaded it to my system.

# About Me
My name is **Wesley** and I am currently pursuing a degree in _Computer Science_. 
I have always been interested in Computers and how they work, and I enjoy problem solving and finding out where and how things work the way they do.

This will be my _third_ college degree, and I am excited to see where this course of study takes me in my life and career.

One of my favorite quotes, and something that helps me stay focused throughout many areas of life is from **Charles R. Swindoll**:
>I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.

## My Interests
* I really enjoy reading, especially **sci-fi** and **mystery** books.
* I enjoy computer games, currently **Satisfactory** and **Deadlock**.
* I also **_love_** bowling.
  * This is something I picked up my first time in college and have found an unexpected passion for since then.

## Interesting Websites
I **highly** recommend your local library website. It is an invaluable resource for borrowing e-books. [Here is the website for information on my local library e-book lending program.](https://www.wake.gov/departments-government/libraries/e-books-downloads) 

This is a little website I created after I decided to purchase my own domain name for various reasons, [Wesley's Wonderland](https://wesleyswonderland.com/).  
**_Please note that the website may contain some curse words._**
